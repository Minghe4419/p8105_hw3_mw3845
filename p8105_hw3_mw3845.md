The `ny_noaa` dataset contains 2595176 rows and 7 columns.The variables
are weather station `id`, `date` of observation, percipitation `prcp` of
the snow, snowfall (mm), snow depth (mm), minimum `tmin` and maximum
`tmax` of the temperature (tenth of the Celsius degree).

##### data cleaning

In snowfall variable, we found that 0 is the most common value,
indicating that there is no snow in NYC for most of the days in the
year. `NA` is the second most common value in `snow` indicating that
there is lots of missingness. We might need to investigate the reason
for such amount of missingness before conducting more in-depth analysis.

``` r
ny_noaa %>% 
  count(snow) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 × 2
    ##     snow       n

``` r
ny_noaa = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax),
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin))
```

\#####Average tmax for January and July Below if a two-panel plot
showing the maximum temps of January and July from all stations across
the year. As expected, mean temperature in January is much lower than
July. All stations appear to follow similar trends of temperature peaks
and valleys within a month across the years. We do see one
uncharacteristically cold station in July of 1987 or 1988, as well as a
few other less drastic outliers.

``` r
ny_noaa %>% 
  group_by(id, year, month) %>% 
  filter(month %in% c(1, 7)) %>% 
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE, color = id)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax, group = id)) + geom_point() + geom_path() +
  facet_grid(~month) +
  labs(title = "Mean monthly temperature for each station across years for January and July")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id', 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

Below we show a two-panel plot including (i) a hex plot of tmax vs tmin
for the full dataset; and (ii) a ridge plot showing the distribution of
snowfall values (in mm) greater than 0 and less than 100 separately by
year.

From the hex plot we see that while there is some variability, the
majority of the data cluster tightly in the center of the distribution.
In relatively rare cases, it seems that tmax is less than tmin, which
raises questions about data recording and quality.

From the ridge plot, we see a multimodal density of snowfall within a
given year. Most stations see between 0 and 35 mm of snow in a year.
Then there is a another group of stations that see about 45 mm of snow,
and another group that sees nearly 80 mm. It is likely this
multimodality stems from the conversion of measurements in one system
(fractions of an inch) to another (using the metric system), which was
also noted in the table of common values.

``` r
#hex plot of tmax vs tmin
hex = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_hex()
#ridge plot of snowfall dist
ridge = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  filter(snow < 100, snow > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = snow, y = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_density_ridges()

hex + ridge

\# Problem 2

##### Read and clean the demographic and MIMS datasets

``` r
mims_df = read_csv('./data/nhanes_accel.csv') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 1441
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (1441): SEQN, min1, min2, min3, min4, min5, min6, min7, min8, min9, min1...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
demo_df = read_csv('./data/nhanes_covar.csv', skip = 4) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (5): SEQN, sex, age, BMI, education
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
merged_df = inner_join(demo_df, mims_df, by = "seqn") %>% 
  filter(age >= 21) %>% 
  drop_na(sex, age, bmi, education) %>% 
  mutate(sex = factor(sex,
                      levels = c(1, 2),
                      labels = c("Male", "Female"),
                      ordered = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(education = factor(education,
                            levels = c(1, 2, 3),
                            labels = c("Less than high school", "High school equivalent", "More than high school"),
                            ordered = TRUE))
```

##### Table and Visualization

After cleaning the data, we want to create a user friendly table for the
number of men and women in each education category. Then visualize the
age distributions for men and women in each education category.

The `sex_edu_table` contains ordered factor variable `education` and
count of `Male` and `Female` for each educational levels. Then we use
`geom_density` to visualize the age distribution for men and women in
three different plots represents three education level.

``` r
sex_edu_table = merged_df %>% 
  group_by(sex, education) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  spread(key = sex, value = count)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

``` r
sex_edu_table
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 3
    ##   education               Male Female
    ##   <ord>                  <int>  <int>
    ## 1 Less than high school     27     28
    ## 2 High school equivalent    35     23
    ## 3 More than high school     56     59

``` r
merged_df %>%
  select(education, age, sex) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(~ education) +
  labs(title = "Age Density by Sex and Education Level",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Density",
       fill = "Sex") +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
